    <h1>ü•ê Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape
      of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated
      dough.Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. The dough
      is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession,
      then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The
      process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
